first check the circuit to see if it works the normal way.(https://www.instructables.com/ZVS-Driver/)
then try out the circuit in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jkrJ8D7Gnc  (basically you just use seperate 12v power supply for the gate of the mosfet to reduce blowing it!)

for high voltage supply:

    for inductor use a flyback core(the one that has less space for primary coil) and wind wire around it.
